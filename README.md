# DaScript First Steps

Technically second steps though... But first with decs.

## Goals

- Try to learn a bit of [DaScript](https://dascript.org)
- Use ECS (decs, native to DaScript) as much as possible (even if better/faster/whatever approaches
were possible)
- Have fun. And what could be more fun than exploring and reinventing wheels...

## How It Was

This was actually a "hackathon" project, where I was supposed to write a game in two days. But since
I can't really settle on a single idea while free-roaming I've spent most of my time tinkering with
DaScript and decs. So it's not really a game. You can't win or loose. You can use HJKL or gamepad to
shoot goo that tends to accumulate in space around you. Gamepad is recommended.

But my goals were nevertheless achieved. I've faced some bugs, some inconveniences and oddities. But
it was actually fun to do. Probably, partially because doing it old-school way (no syntax highlight,
no debugger, like I did in childhood on paper) went mostly flawless.
